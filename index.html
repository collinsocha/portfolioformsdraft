		<p>I am currently a sophomore at the University of Michigan applying to the School of Information.
        I am interested in Information Tech, Biotech, Climatetech, Cleantech AI, AR/VR, and Metaverse related tech. 
        My schooling experiences and entrepreneurial endeavors have given me insight into the dynamics of a business-tech career and effectively communicating with professionals and clients.</p>

		<p>I am originally from Weston, Connecticut where I played varsity soccer, ran varsity track,
            and was the President of the my high school environmental club known as the 
            <a href = "https://westontoday.news/articles/191008-green-ribbon">Green Team</a>.
            After the COVID pandemic began during my senior year of high school, 
            I began working on my first entreprenurial project known as SumCollege.
            This began my journey as a tech entrepreneur now having worked on several
            different startup teams.
